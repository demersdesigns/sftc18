# What is StarFun Theater Camp?

StarFun Theater Camp is all about your children having FUN and expressing themselves through theater!
StarFun Theater Camp is intended for children in grades 1-8. The camp runs for six weeks and is divided into three different sessions.

We’ll be producing and performing new musical productions during each session. We’ll rehearse every day, and in addition, the campers will assist in making their costumes, scenery and props. By the end of each session, each group will perform for a live audience of family and friends!

We have a certified staff with over twenty years of theater experience who can’t wait to help your child shine!

# Our Programs
## The Camper Program
Most camp activities at StarFun are directly related to putting on a show at the end of each session. Every day the children will have classes related to the production of the play. These will involve set design and creation of props, learning and rehearsing lines and songs, as well as learning and rehearsing choreography and stage movement.

There will be two breaks in the morning; one for snack and one for outdoor play, as well as a lunch break and outdoor break in the afternoon. Each child will bring his or her own snack and lunch to camp.

Transportation is not provided.

“My time at camp has always been great, the counselors became like family as did the campers, and I expanded my horizons. I have always had a great time and learned so much. Many of my favorite summer memories are from my sessions at StarFun”

— 6 Year Camper J.D.

## The Counselor Assistant Program
The Counselor Assistant Program (CA) is a leadership training program for children who have aged out of being a “Camper”, but are still interested in participating in StarFun Theater Camp. CA’s need to be self-starters who are eager and willing to assist the counselors. There is no upper age limit for the CA program.
